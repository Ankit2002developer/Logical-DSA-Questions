# [Middle of a linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/finding-middle-element-in-a-linked-list/1)

<p>
  Given the head of a linked list, the task is to find the middle. For example, the middle of 1-> 2->3->4->5 is 3. If there are two middle nodes (even count), return the second middle. For example, middle of 1->2->3->4->5->6 is 4.
